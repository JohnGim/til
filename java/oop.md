# Object-oriented Programming

--

Many times, what I've learned in Simulation Science is coded officially in the tech world in vocabulary that I just haven't learned yet.

* Abstraction: process of simplifying reality with only relevant information you want for the application.

* Objects: In Java, the objects are stored in classes. They have properties that store information and methods are functions or procedures that modify with or on the information in the objects.

* Encapsulation: Hide data and complexity for different audiences.

* Inheritance: Deriving methods and properties from another object. This creates hierarchies of objects.

* Polymorphism: A class can implement an inherited method in a customized way. For example, a Customer may modify information via a SaveDetails() method that is to a different database than the parent Person class.
